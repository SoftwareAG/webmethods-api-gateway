    "description" : "API Gateway User Management Service allows you to manage Users,Groups and Accessprofiles in the API Gateway. Any user with the 'Manage user management' functional privilege can manage the APIs in the API Gateway. By default, the users who are part of API-Gateway-Administrators groups will have this privilege.\n\nAPI Gateway is shipped with the following predefined access profiles:\n\t- Administrators: By default, all the functional privileges are assigned to the Administrators access profile and these privileges cannot be modified.\n\tAPI-Gateway-Providers: By default, the following functional privileges are assigned to the API-Gateway-Providers access profile and these privileges cannot be modified:\n\t\t* Manage APIs, Manage Applications, Manage policy templates, Manage packages and plans, Export assets, Execute service result cache APIs, Activate APIs, Manage aliases, Activate packages, Import assets\n\nFunctional privileges are a list of API Gateway related tasks that you can assign to an access profile that is associated to groups. API Gateway allows you to assign functional privileges to a user or group (LDAP or local) using access profiles. The functional privileges are grouped together to form an access profile, which is associated to a group. You can create an access profile, add functional privileges with the profile, associate groups to access profiles, and delete an access profile. For example, you can assign functional privileges such as managing APIs, managing applications, managing policies, managing importing assets can be assigned to a user group after grouping the privileges in an access profile.",
