    "description" : "API Gateway Administration Service provides interface for you to administer various functions of the API Gateway. The user needs to have different functional privileges to administer different functions. For example, in order to manage runtime transactions data of the API Gateway, the user needs to have 'Manage purge and restore runtime events' privilege. By default, the users who are part of API-Gateway-Administrators group will have all privileges. \n\nFollowing Administration functions are exposed using this API. \n\n1. Archive, purge and restore api transactions. \n\nThis function lets the users manage the API Gateway Runtime Events & Metrics data.   \n\nAPI Gateway generates different types of events in the runtime depending on the state of the API invocation. For example, an error event is generated when API Gateway encounters an error while processing the API request or the response.  API Metrics is an aggregated data computed from the different events that happen in the system. These metrics provides information about the key performance indicators of an API like its \"Availability\", \"Fault Count\" etc which are useful for monitoring & governing the service performance and service level agreements.  The API providers has a variety of options to choose from for storing these events and metrics. By default, API Gateway store will be used for storing this data.  Here are some details about different type of events.\n\nTransactional event: Provides a summary (request & response) of each runtime transaction in the system. It is generated when a Log Invocation policy is included for the API. For example, if an API has this policy attached to it, then for every invoke the system generates a transaction event.  \n\nError event: Provides details of an error that occurred during an API invoke. This event is generated whenever there is an error in the system during a runtime service invocation. \n\nMonitoring event: This event is generated based on the parameters configured in the API monitoring policies such as Monitor Service Level Agreements, Throttling etc. Monitoring could be done based on various parameters such as Total Request Count, Total Success Count, Response Time, Availability. Monitoring can be done at the consumer application level too so that each consumer can be tracked individually. \n \nPolicy violation event: Provides a summary of the policy violations that occurred in the system. When a policy attched to an API is violated, the system generates the policy violation event.\n\nLifeCycle event: Provides a summary of the life cycle of the API Gateway instance. Whenever the instance is started or stopped, a life cycle notification is generated.\n\nThreat protection events: Provides a summary of the threat protection filter and rule violations. When a filter or rule is violated, the system generates the threat protection violation event. \n\nManaging the Events/Metrics Data\n\nPurge: The process of systematically deleting unwanted data from the database is called purging. You can purge events from the API Gateway store by setting the required date or duration in the API Gateway. You must have the required functional privileges to purge the API analytics data.\n\nArchive: Moving data that is no longer actively used for long-term retention so that it can be used at a later time is called archiving. You can archive API analytics data by setting the required date or duration per tenant in the API Gateway. You must have the required functional privileges to archive the API analytics data.\n\nRestore: You can restore the archived data as required. \n\n\n2.Transaction based license: \n\nAPI Gateway supports core as well as transaction-based licensing model. When API Gateway uses a transaction-based licensing model, then each service invocation is considered as a transaction and API Gateway keeps a track of these transactions. API Gateway transactions for the current month are compared with the maximum number of transactions allowed in a month.When the usage breaches, notification will be generated for the current month. Apart from this if the user wants to generate notifications before usage breach itself when usage reaches to some x% like 70% or 80% then the user has to add notification criteria at 70% or 80%. By default API Gateway will have two default notification criteria's at 90%, 100%.\n\n\n3.Destination configuration: \n\nAPI Gateway can publish events and performance metrics data to the configured destinations. You must have the API Gateway's manage destination configurations functional privilege assigned to configure the following destinations to which the event types and performance metrics data is published:\nAPI Gateway\nAPI Portal\nAudit Log\nCentraSite\nDatabase\nDigital Events\nElasticsearch\nEmail\nSNMP \n\n\n4.Default API fault configuration: \n\n API provider can configure a global error handling behaviour. In case of the native service error, the provider may choose to either forward the native error as is or can choose to modify the error response. In case the provider chooses to provide a custom error response, he/she can use the default error template containing standard aliases. These alias values will be replaced with the request specific information before the response is sent to the client. The standard aliases like the error message, service, operation, date/time, IP address, user and consumer application can be used in the template. The custom error response configuration is applicable for the errors thrown by API Gateway also.\n\n\n5.Custom assertions: \n\nCustom assertions allow the API providers to extend and provide additional security policies that are not available by default in API Gateway. Kindly refer to Policy swagger documentation for information about these configurations. \n\n\n6.SAML Issuer: \n\nIf a native API is enforced with the SAML policy, API Gateway uses this configuration to communicate to STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve the SAMl token. This is internally stored as an alias, kindly refer Alias Swagger documentation for information about these configurations.\n\n\n7.OAuth 2.0: \n\nAPI Gateway allows the API provider to configure any 3rd party OAuth2 Authorization server. In this case API Gateway acts as Resource server. Use can refer to Alias Swagger documentation for information about configuring external Authorization server.\n\n\n8.OpenID Provider: \n\nAPI GAteway allows the API provider to configure any OpenId provider. In this case API Gateway acts as Relying Party. YUse can refer to Alias Swagger documentation for information about configuring openid provider.\n\n9. Approval \n\nAPI Gateway allows you to configure approvals for: \n\t- Create application: To enforce approvals for creating an application in API Gateway.\n\t- Register application: To enforce approvals for associating an application with APIs.\n\t- Update application: To enforce approvals for modifying an application.\n\t- Subscribe package: To enforce approvals in API Gateway to enable API Portal consumers for subscribing a package to a plan in API Portal.\n\nIn API Gateway, you can create an application and associate (register) the application created with APIs. If you have the API Gateway's manage general administration configurations functional privilege assigned, you can configure approvals for creating or registering an application. If you have configured approvers, and if a user wants to create and register an application in API Gateway, then the application is created and registered with an API only if any one approver from the approvers group approves the create application and the register application requests. Similarly, you can configure approvals for updating an application or subscribing a package.\n\n10. Load Balancer \n\nIf you cluster API Gateway instances, you must configure API Gateway with the load balancer URL. This is the URL to which the consumer applications sends the requests to. Also this URL will be used to generate the API endpoint during activation.\n\n11. API Portal Configuration Management \n\n This API is used for managing API Portal configurations in API Gateway.\n\nThe API Provider can define APIs in API Gateway, secure and monitor them and then may choose to publish these APIs to the API Portal. API Portal enables an organization to securely expose APIs to external developers, partners, and other consumers for use in building their own applications.\n\nAny user with 'Manage Destinations' functional privilege can configure API Portal connection in API Gateway.  APIs/Packages can be published from API Gateway to API Portal if and only if the API Portal configuration changes are done successfully.",
